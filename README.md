# ipdTournament

For an overview of this project and the tournament, read the [wiki](https://github.com/tenchd/ipdTournament/wiki/Iterated-Prisoner's-Dilemma-Tournament:--Motivation-&-Details).

## How to Write a Submission

If you want to test out a strategy, add it as a Submission object in the deciders.py file (which also contains examples you can start from), then add that submission object to the list of submissions in the main function of ipd.py.  Then run ipd.py.

## Visualization

Users who have access to a bash terminal and have R installed can run play_n_plot.sh to run a dummy tournament and generate charts summarizing the results.  Requires installation of tidyverse package for R.
